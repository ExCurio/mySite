				<h3>Title: Week 3 - Blog Post</h3>
				<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is my week 3 - Blog Post</p>
				<p class="greeting">Greetings fellow students, cyber-scholars, and seekers of knowledge! My name is Keith Harrison, and it is my pleasure to meet you all as we embark on this epic journey together. By day, and at times by night, I ply my trade as a cyber-security engineer. I spent most of my childhood in Virginia, where I spent countless days roaming the battlefields of Yorktown, exploring the settlement of Jamestown, and wandering the cobblestone streets of Colonial Williamsburg. After high school, I joined the US Naval Special Forces, where I traveled to 17 different countries, Bulgaria and Romania (talk about local myths and legends!) being two of my favorites. Currently, I spend my free time with my wife and our four, slightly neurotic and yet incredibly lovable, rescue dogs (meaning, dogs from a rescue â€¦ they are entirely too minuscule to rescue anyone) and a surly cat that recently adopted us, on our farm in Colorado. Other areas of interest include watching the Big Bang Theory, reading fantasy and science fiction entirely too much, playing video games, and watching movies.</p>
